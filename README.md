[00:22.07] Go ahead, go ahead and smash it on the floor
[00:28.43] Take whatever's left, and take it with you out the door
[00:37.20] See if I cry
[00:39.63] See if I shed a single sorry tear
[00:44.66] Can't say it's been that way
[00:46.84] No, in fact it's been wasted on you
[01:04.34] 
[00:52.08] Everybody sees and everyone agrees that you and I are old
[01:02.93] And it's been that way too long
[01:06.62] Take it as it comes, and be thankful when it's done
[01:13.35] There's so many ways to act
[01:17.51] And there's many shades of black
[01:21.38] There's so many shades of black
[01:24.78] There's so many shades of black

[01:30.22] Let it out, let it all out and say what's on your mind
[01:35.94] You can kick and scream, and shout and say things that are so unkind, yeah!
[01:44.63] See if I care
[01:47.42] See if I stand firm or if I fall
[01:51.60] 'Cause in the back of my mind, and on the tip of my tongue is the answer to you
[02:31.10] 
[01:59.92] Everybody sees and everyone agrees that you and I are old
[02:10.63] And it's been that way too long
[02:15.17] Take it as it comes, and be thankful when it's done
[02:21.86] There's so many ways to act
[02:25.92] And there's many shades of black
[02:29.02] There's so many shades of black
[02:33.19] Yeah, there's many shades of black

[03:10.40] Yeah, everybody sees and everyone agrees that you and I are old
[03:22.10] And it's been that way too long
[03:25.53] Take it as it comes, and be thankful when it's done
[03:32.87] There's so many ways to act
[03:36.76] And you cannot take it back (there's many shades)
[03:40.59] Oh, you cannot take it back (of black)
[03:59.59] 
[03:44.43] 'Cause there's many shades of black
[03:48.09] You have many shades of black
[03:51.89] You have many, you have many shades of black
[03:59.07] 'Cause there's many shades of black
[04:02.94] There's so many shades of black
[04:05.94] There's so many shades of black
[04:09.84] There's so many shades of black, oh, oh
